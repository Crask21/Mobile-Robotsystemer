The file MainSender sends a preprogrammed data package, to send a custom package change the values in the python file and recompile. Alternatively to send a custom package the GUI.exe file can be used. To read on the end receiving computer run the MainReceive.exe. To run the program on the robot use the mainTurtlebot.py program.
